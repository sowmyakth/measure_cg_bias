# measure_cg_bias
Code to measure bias from galaxy color gradients in weak lensing measurements.
CG bias is measure for 
1. reference parametric galaxy with bulge and disk
2. Galaxies from Catsim
3. HST V/I band images from AEGIS 


notebooks directory contains ipython notebooks containing plots showing results
from analysis and can be used to visulaize the galaxies and PSFs used in the 
analysis.

data directory contains template SEDs, LSST filter response curves, and HST noise
correlation functions used in the analysis.
